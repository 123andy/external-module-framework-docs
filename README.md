# REDCap External Module Framework Documentation
You've reached the official documenation for REDCap's External Module Framework.  If you're new to External Module development, [University of Florida's Development Guide](https://ctsit.github.io/redcap_external_module_development_guide) is a great starting point.  We are considering merging part 4 of this guide directly into this repo to ensure it automatically stays up to date over time as framework changes are made.

These docs and the External Module Framework itself are both very much a community effort. If/when you notice room for improvement, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/external-module-framework-docs/issues/new).  It is also highly encouraged to [fork this repo](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/external-module-framework-docs/fork), make any changes you desire, then go to the `Pull Requests` tab from your fork and select `New pull request`.
