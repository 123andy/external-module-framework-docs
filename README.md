# REDCap External Module Framework Documentation
You've reached the official documenation for REDCap's External Module Framework.  These docs and the External Module Framework itself are both very much a community effort. If/when you notice room for improvement, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/external-module-framework-docs/issues/new), or make the changes yourself via a new [branch](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/external-module-framework-docs/branches) and a [pull request](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/external-module-framework-docs/compare).

If you're new to External Modules development, the [University of Florida's Development Guide](https://ctsit.github.io/redcap_external_module_development_guide) is a great starting point.  We are considering merging part 4 of this guide directly into this repo to ensure it automatically stays up to date over time as framework changes are made.
