## External Module Framework - Official Documentation

"External Modules" is a class-based framework replacing legacy plugins and hooks in REDCap. Modules can utilize any of the "REDCap" class methods (e.g., \REDCap::getData), and they also come with many other helpful built-in methods to store and manage settings for a given module, as well as provide support for internationalization (translation of displayed strings) of modules. The documentation provided on this page will be useful for anyone creating an external module.

If you have created a module and wish to share it with the REDCap community, you may submit it to the [REDCap External Modules Submission Survey](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=X83KEHJ7EA). If your module gets approved after submission, it will become available for download by any REDCap administrator from the [REDCap Repo](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/modules/).
