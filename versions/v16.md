## Framework Version 16

See the [Versioning README](README.md) for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- Modules are no longer allowed to include Twig as a dependency.  If your module includes Twig as dependency, remove it and use the built-in Twig version described below instead.  If you're coming from Twig major version 1 or 2, you may have to [make some changes](https://symfony.com/blog/preparing-your-applications-for-twig-3) for your module to support Twig version 3.


#### New Features

- [Twig Templating Engine](https://twig.symfony.com/) version 3 is now included in the External Module Framework.  More details, see the [Twig documentation page](../twig.md).
